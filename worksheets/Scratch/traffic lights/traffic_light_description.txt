This tutorial guides beginners in coding clubs or those new to coding on how to use Scratch 3 and a Raspberry Pi to control a set of three LEDs simulating a traffic light sequence. It explains the basics of connecting the LEDs to GPIO pins, accessing Scratch 3 on the Raspberry Pi, and using Scratch's visual coding blocks. The tutorial covers topics such as turning LEDs on and off, creating sequences with broadcasts, and building a complete traffic light sequence. It concludes with an extra challenge to modify the program for flashing amber lights and encourages learners to experiment with their own LED sequences. Overall, it provides a hands-on introduction to programming and hardware interaction in a fun and educational way.
