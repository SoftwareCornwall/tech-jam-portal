Flappy Astronaut is an engaging Raspberry Pi project that guides learners through the creation of a Flappy Bird-inspired game using the Sense HAT and Python. Participants will explore various aspects of digital making and coding while creating a fun and interactive game. They will learn how to illuminate Sense HAT LEDs, use the Sense HAT joystick for navigation, and utilize 2D lists to represent the game screen. This project provides hands-on experience in physical computing and game development. Whether using physical hardware or an emulator, participants will enjoy the process of coding their own Flappy Astronaut game on the Raspberry Pi platform.
