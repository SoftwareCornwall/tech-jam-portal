This tutorial guides you through the creation of a digital pet using the Raspberry Pi Sense HAT. The digital pet will be capable of detecting movement, allowing you to take it for a virtual walk. Through this project, you will learn how to use Python programming to manipulate the Sense HAT's LED matrix, employ loops and functions, and utilize the Sense HAT's accelerometer for interactive behavior.
